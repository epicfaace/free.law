<p class="lead">These instructions show you how to run our macOS app to gather and share cases from Harvard's Caselaw Access Project.</p>

By using this software, you will use your credentials to gather legal cases from the Harvard Caselaw Access Project. The items that you gather will then be shared with us. Once shared with us, we upload them to the Internet Archive, a permanent digital public library.

Thank you for your interest in joining this effort. When this is complete we will have unlocked centuries of important legal data. Finally, the law will be freely accessible to everybody who needs it.


**Note:** By providing these instructions and this software, we neither encourage nor endorse the use of their software, your API, or any related software. Using our docker image is *your* choice, and before making any choice we encourage *you* to evaluate any necessary terms, laws, conditions, or other rules or regulations that may apply. 


## The Short Version

1. Install Legal API Downloader on macOS from the Mac App Store.

2. Configure it with your API key from https://case.law.


## The Long Version

Before beginning, you must:


1. Search for Legal API Downloader on the Mac App Store and install the application.

    <div class="text-center">
    <img src="{filename}/images/mac-app-store-page.png"
         alt="Legal API Downloader Page "
         class="img-responsive border"/>
    </div>


2. When install is complete, the app should launch automatically. If not navigate to your application directory and start Legal API Downloader.  A preference window will open and an alert asking for permission to start after a reboot.

3. Add your API Key or Select *Click to Register for an API Key* to open the Case.Law user registration.

    ![Mac App Store]({filename}/images/mac-app-pref-window.png "Optional title")

4. Once registration is complete and you have verified your email select *Click to find your API Key* button.  This will take you to login to Case.Law one more time to get your API Key. Copy and paste the key into the API Key textfield and close the window. If the API key is correct the app will start working immediately.

5. FYI, Legal API Downloader is conveniently tucked away in your menu bar, where you can easily monitor your progress.   

    <div class="text-center">
    <img src="{filename}/images/mac-app-top-bar.png"
         alt="Legal API Downloader Page "
         class="img-responsive border"/>
    </div>

6. Sit back and relax.

Good luck and thank you!
