In 1945, the Supreme Court ruled in [_Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. United Mine Workers of America_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewell_Ridge_Coal_Corp._v._United_Mine_Workers_of_America) that the time coal miners spent underground, traveling between two coal mines, owned by their employer was part of the same work week, and thus compensatable.

This rather innocuous and seemingly obvious 5-4 ruling was also notable, as it led to what became known as the Black-Jackson Feud. This Feud went beyond the issue at hand, and rather focused on the fact that Justice Hugo Black refused to disqualify himself from the case which was being argued by his former law partner and personal lawyer, thus creating an appearance of a conflict of interest.

The conflict between the justices was so significant, that it is rumored that the stress from the [Black-Jackson feud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewell_Ridge_Coal_Corp._v._United_Mine_Workers_of_America#Black–Jackson_feud) led [Chief Justice Harlan Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_F._Stone) to an early grave.

Three years later Congress chose to re-codify into law the judicial ethics regarding disqualification, a step towards the current standard we have today. The test for disqualification of a federal judge under [11 USCS § 455(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/455) is whether reasonable persons with knowledge of all facts would be led to conclusion that judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.

Here at Free Law Project we got to thinking about how an average citizen could become make their own conclusions and started to research the topic. Here is what we found

1. All federal judges (and some clerks) are required to file a financial disclosure with the Administrative Office of the Courts ("AO") once a year.
2. These disclosures detail `positions`, `agreements`, `gifts`, `reimbursements`, `investments`, `non-investment incomes` of the judge, as well  the `spouses' non-investment income`.
3. The financial disclosures are available to the public for 6 years.
4. After 6 years the disclosures disappear from the public eye forever.

As a non-profit dedicated to making the legal world more accessible, we thought this information should be more widely available. Therefore today we are announcing the completion of a new database and API in Courtlistener on financial disclosures.  

The database includes over 26,000 financial disclosure detailing over 1,600 gifts, 14,000 debts and 1.5 million investments.  In fact we discovered that the average net-worth of a federal judge is XXX million dollars (or rougly XX times the average american), with many members of the bench having net-worths in excess of 100 milliion dollars.

The massive amount of data and documents collected and parsed required custom built tools specifically for these documents which anyone can access and use at [DISCLOSURE EXTRACTOR]().  

Lastly, we are happy to announce a partnership with Pulitzer Prize winning journalist James Grimaldi, and Coulter Jones of the Wall Street Journal with whom we provided early access to our API.  Today you can read the first in a series of articles they have been working on [HERE WSJ LINK]().

For others that may be excited by our work, we plan to rollout complete API access to this new database over the next few months, and can't wait to see what other people will discover.  In the meantime, we look forward to continuning to build and grow this database for many years to come.
