In 1945, the Supreme Court ruled in [_Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. United Mine Workers of America_](WIKIPEDIA) that the time coal miners spent underground, traveling between two coal mines, owned by their employer was part of the same work week, and thus compensatable.

This rather innocuous and seemingly obvious 5-4 ruling was also notable, as it led to what became known as the Black-Jackson Feud. This Feud went beyond the issue at hand, and rather focused on the fact that Justice Hugo Black refused to disqualify himself from the case which was being argued by his former law partner and personal lawyer, thus creating an appearance of a conflict of interest.

The argument over whether Black needed to recuse himself was so significant, that it is rumored that the stress from the [Black-Jackson feud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewell_Ridge_Coal_Corp._v._United_Mine_Workers_of_America#Black–Jackson_feud) led [Chief Justice Harlan Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_F._Stone) to an early grave.

Shortly after the Black-Jackson Feud, Congress chose to re-codify into law the judicial ethics regarding recusals, a step towards the current standard we have today. Currently, the test for disqualification of a judge under [11 USCS § 455(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/455) is whether reasonable persons with knowledge of all facts would be led to conclusion that judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.

Here at Free Law Project we got to thinking about how an average citizen might become aware of all the facts around impartiality and started our own research.

Here is what we found

1. All federal judges (and some clerks) are required to file a financial disclosure with the Administrative Office of the Courts ("AO") once a year.
2. These disclosures detail `positions`, `agreements`, `gifts`, `reimbursements`, `investments`, `non-investment incomes` of the judge, as well  the non-investment income of their spouse.
3. The **AO** makes these financial disclosures available to the public for 6 years, and
4. After 6 years the disclosures disappear from the public eye permanently.

As a non-profit dedicated to making the legal world more accessible, we thought this information should be more widely available. Therefore today we are announcing the completion of a brand new database and API in Courtlistener for financial disclosures.  

This includes over 26,705 financial disclosure and includes more than 1,600 gifts disclosed, over 14,000 debts and roughly 1.5 million investments made by the federal judiciary.

The research, coding and processing of this massive amount of data required custom built tools specifically for financial disclosures which anyone can use at [DISCLOSURE EXTRACTOR]()  

We think this database will be a powerful tool for fairness and impartiality.  In fact, we provided early access to our Financial Disclosure API to
to Pulitzer Prize winning journalist James Grimaldi, and Coulter Jones of the Wall Street Journal.  You can read the first
in a series of articles on what they have discovered [HERE WSJ LINK]() beginning today.

For others excited by our work, we plan to rollout full API access to this database to everyone over the next few months, and can't wait to see what other people will discover.
